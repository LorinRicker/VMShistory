# VMS History and Timeline (repository: VMShistory)

Inception: 31-July-2017  
Last Update: 1-August-2017

## Overview and Background

This repository is unconventional in that it contains no code, but instead is a collection-point for documentation about the history and development of VMS (also known and marketed as "OpenVMS"), from its inception and two-plus decades of development at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), then briefly in the hands of Compaq Computer Corporation (Compaq) when it aquired DEC in 1998, then through the "years in the wilderness", starting in 2001, at the not-so-benign mercies of Hewlett Packard Company (HP, now subdivided as HPE or "Hewlett Packard Enterprise"), and finally, in 2014, to the capable and welcoming hands of VMS Software Incorporated (VSI).

The first ur-document for this history is a textual table (in a very painful format, both to read and to maintain, if anyone would do so), currently available as ["OpenVMS Release History"](http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/os/openvms-release-history.html) and a [downloadable "text only version"](http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/os/openvms-release-history.txt).  This document is preserved, with attribution (although its original author(s) is(are) unknown, likely not anyone at HP/HPE, more likely folks at or from DEC, and inherited by HP), as a component of this repository.

However, the last entry in that ur-document is circa June 2010, with the release of VMS v8.4 -- much has happened since, especially due to VSI's strong capabilities in the form of the resurrected VMS Engineering Team.

The second ur-document for this history is the DEC-published ["Nothing Stops It - VAX/VMS AT 20 -- 1977-1997 ... and beyond"](http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/DEC/vax/dec.vax.vax_at_20.1977-1997.102630370.pdf).  Again, this document's VMS timeline runs only up to v7.1 in December 1996.

## Purpose and Mission

So, for reasons of readability (clarity), maintenance sanity and currency -- bringing the history fully up-to-date -- the information in these documents will be transformed and adapted into a proper table-like document, a semi-official VMS Timeline (to start with, a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, but other forms may derive).

Furthermore, any and all relevant information about VMS development from the points that these documents break off, from ~1998 (the death of DEC and the days in the wilderness) to current-day (the birth of VSI, and their contributions) will be collected and added to this VMS History and Timeline.

Hopefully, the open-source nature and availability of this revised/improved document and format will attract other contributors of information, including:

* People who know and can document corrections and omissions, especially for versions prior to v4.0 which are unaddressed by the ur-document.

* Folks who can provide additional details and/or background.

* Especially from VSI's VMS Engineering Team and from active users (sys-admins, programmers, etc.) of VMS, the new features, functionality and capabilities as released and available.

A reasonably up-to-date formated PDF-document of the VMS History and Timeline will be always available as part of this repository; however, it may be updated only as new facts and entries are actually vetted with supporting documentation and provenance.
