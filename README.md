# VMS History (repository: VMShistory)

## Overview

This repository is unconventional in that it contains no code, but instead is a collection-point for documentation about the history and development of VMS (also known and marketed as "OpenVMS"), from its inception and two-plus decades of development at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), then briefly in the hands of Compaq Computer Corporation (Compaq) when it aquired DEC in 1998, then through the "years in the wilderness", starting in 2001, at the not-so-benign mercies of Hewlett Packard Company (HP, now subdivided as HPE or "Hewlett Packard Enterprise"), and finally, in 2014, to the capable and welcoming hands of VMS Software Incorporated (VSI).

The ur-document for this history is a textual table (in a very painful format, both to read and to maintain, if anyone would do so) currently available as ["OpenVMS Release History"](http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/os/openvms-release-history.html) and downloadable as a ["text only version"](http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/os/openvms-release-history.txt).  This document is preserved, with attribution (although its original author is unknown, likely not anyone at HP/HPE, more likely someone at or from DEC, and inherited by HP), as a component of this repository.

However, the last entry in that ur-document is circa Jun 2010, with the release of VMS v8.4 -- much has happened since, especially due to VSI's strong capabilities in the form of the resurrected VMS Engineering Team.

So, for reasons of readability (clarity), maintenance sanity and currency (bringing it up-to-date), the information in that ur-doc is (will be) transformed and adapted into a proper table-like document, a semi-official VMS Timeline (to start with, a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, but other forms may derive).

Hopefully, the open-source nature and availability of this revised/improved document and format will attract other contributors of information, including:

* People who know and can document corrections and omissions.

* Folks who can provide additional details and/or background.

* Especially from VSI's VMS Engineering Team and from active users (sys-admins, programmers, etc.) of VMS, the new features, functionality and capabilities as released and available.

A reasonably up-to-date formated PDF-document of the VMS Timeline will be always available as part of this repository; however, it may be updated only as new facts and entries are actually vetted with supporting documentation and provenance.
